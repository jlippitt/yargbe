# YAR-GBE
Yet Another Rust Game Boy Emulator

## Current Features

* All graphics functionality working
* Majority of audio functionality working (frequency sweep is missing)
* Support for MBC1 and MBC3 cartridge types (though not for real time clock)

## Features Still To Come

* Graphical scaling (2X, 4X, etc.)
* Frequency sweep
* Other cartridge types (and MBC3 real time clock)
* 'Battery-backed RAM' (i.e. save files on disk)
* Game Boy Color support (maybe)

## What Probably Won't Be Implemented

* Serial port (as it doesn't seem to make much sense on an emulator)
